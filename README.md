# my-python-scripts
This is a collection of my Python scripts as I learn data analysis and visualisation in Python. My first scripts are written in a way which works with my samples but they need editing (eg. in the data path, separator of tables, scale and so on...) if someone else wants to utilize them. 

# cluster.py: 

This script will draw a cluster map with the Seaborn of a data set using a Bray-Curtis distance matrix.
