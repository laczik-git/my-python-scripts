# my-python-scripts
This is a collection of my Python scripts as I learn data analysis and visualisation in Python. My first scripts are written in a way which works with my samples but they need editing (eg. in the data path, separator of tables, scale and so on...) if someone else wants to utilize them. 

## Stacked_perc_bar.py

This script creates a stacked percentage bar of a data set

## HeatMap.py


## cluster.py: 

This script will draw a cluster map of a data set with the Seaborn data visualization library using a Bray-Curtis distance matrix. Please visit https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.clustermap.html to find out more about the parameters.
