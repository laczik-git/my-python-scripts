# my-python-scripts
This is a collection of my very first Python scripts as I learned data analysis and visualisation in Python. I will add more as I deepen my knowledge of Python.  My first scripts are written in a way which works with my samples but they need editing (eg. in the data path, separator of tables, scale and so on...) if someone else wants to utilize them. Feel free to change any of the code for your purpose.

## Stacked_perc_bar.py

This script creates a stacked percentage bar of a data set. 

## HeatMap.py
This will create a heatmap of a dataset. The dataset is read from a file via Pandas. The Y-axis labels are italic since originally I used the script to visualize metagenomic data with bacterial species on Y-axes. Guide for the Seaborn heatmap: https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.heatmap.html#seaborn.heatmap

## cluster.py

This script will draw a cluster map of a data set with the Seaborn data visualization library using a Bray-Curtis distance matrix. Please visit https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.clustermap.html to find out more about the parameters.
